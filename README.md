🚀 Responsive Landing Page with Fixed Navigation

This project is a responsive landing page built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It features a fixed navigation bar that remains visible on all pages, dynamically changes its style on scroll, highlights the active section while scrolling, and provides hover effects for better interactivity.

📌 Features

✅ Fixed Navigation Bar

The navigation menu stays at the top (position: fixed) and is always visible.

✅ Scroll-based Styling

When the user scrolls down, the navbar changes its background and adds a shadow for better readability.

✅ Hover Effects

Menu items highlight (color + slight animation) when hovered for improved UX.

✅ Active Section Highlight

As the user scrolls through the sections, the corresponding navigation link becomes highlighted using the Intersection Observer API.

✅ Responsive Design

Works across desktop, tablet, and mobile screens with a clean layout.

✅ Smooth Scrolling

Navigation links smoothly scroll to their respective sections.

🛠️ Technologies Used

HTML5 → Page structure

CSS3 → Styling, hover effects, responsive design

JavaScript (Vanilla JS) → Scroll detection, Intersection Observer for active links

📂 Project Structure
├── index.html   # Main landing page with nav, sections, footer
├── README.md    # Project documentation


(If you split CSS/JS into separate files, you can add style.css and script.js here too.)

🚀 How to Run

git clone https://github.com/your-username/responsive-landing.git

📸 Preview

Navbar is transparent at the top, but when you scroll, it becomes darker with shadow.

Active menu items get highlighted with an accent color.

Hovering over links animates them with a smooth lift effect.

✨ Future Improvements (Optional Ideas)

Add a hamburger menu for small screens.

Smooth animations on section entry.

Convert into a multi-page setup (About, Services, Contact as separate pages).
